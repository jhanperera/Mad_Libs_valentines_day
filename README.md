# Madlibs for Valentines Day

This project is [Diana Lee](https://github.com/dianalee1022) and [Jhan Perera](https://github.com/jhanperera) submission for the [FLOOD OF LOVE VALENTINE'S DAY FUN CHALLENGE](https://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30056350/?type=develop).

This web application is built so users can play a valentineâ€™s day themed madlibs game and see funny and creative results based on their inputs.

This web app was based off [Restaurant Template](https://gumroad.com/l/free-one-page-restaurant-html-css-template). 

## Getting Started

Simply open the index.html file in Chrome or Firefox to have fun. (IE and Safari don't play nicely with our web app).

### Prerequisites

NONE!

### Installing

NONE!


## Deployment

This web application was developed using the [Base](http://getbase.org/). Most of the logic is simple Javascript with a Gulp task runner to easily build and minify everything.
